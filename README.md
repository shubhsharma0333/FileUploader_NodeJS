# FileUploader_NodeJS

in this project i have used javascript, node.js, ejs a typical javascript component to achive a basic functionallity, i thing react could have taken the place of ejs but i felt like there is less repetiton and we weren't aiming for a complex/interactive UI insted using core javascript was simple and less complex making functionality straight forward
